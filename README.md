# OAuth Gateway

We at Redoo Networks searched a way to provide a very easy OAuth Interface for clients, 
which are not able to setup an own API Access in Software.

Because we don't want to share our private Client Secret, we need to find a way, 
which don't break into private information, but is able to forward OAuth Requests and Responses from Client CRM to OAuth Providers
